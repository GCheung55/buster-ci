# buster-ci


The idea of this module is to provide a way of starting the **Buster.JS** server,
capture the browsers, run the tests and close the browsers at once.

The current approach is to have agents running on every system, where browsers should be started for the test run.
For a first try, the implementation can handle only one agent and that agent can only start the chrome browser.
